    <h1>Modern cybersecurity</h1>

    		These days most of the world is connected in the vast and evergrowing network that we uniformly call the Internet. Our current estimates show, that the Internet is accessible to a mindboggling 4.66 billion people. That is, about 60% of the entire population can go and explore this web of seemingly limitless information and possibilities.
    	</header>
    	<p>
    		With this great connectivity, of course, comes a great need for sophisticated cybersecurity as well as innovative encryption algorithms. The safeguarding tactics used to protect user privacy information and authentication methodology has come a long way in the past century or so. [instert some generalised notes from the past security webpage].

			Even though computer power has increased by many orders of magnitude, the main principles regarding information have remained the same. The fundamental tenets of information security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. According to the LBMC, every element of an information security program should be designed to achieve one or more of these principles. As such, many programmers aim to implement security measures that are both incredibly difficult to break, but intuitive to use, implement and control.

			To dive into the specific examples of modern cybersecurity, it would be useful to firstly have a look at the most common threats that we have to identify and learn to combat.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most famous forms of cybernetic threats out there are not even based in the digital world, but instead focuses on manipulating human beings and is often referred to as social engineering.
			...
		</p>
		<p>
			The most well know and most often thought of threat that people want to be protected from is hacking.
			...
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, we have various malicious malware which can range from adding an annoying screen-melting effect to having all of your data locked in a virtually unbreakable vault, only accessible after you pay hundreds of dollars.
			...
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, these threats sound worrisome and sometimes disguise themselves incredibly well, thus are difficult to avoid. Luckily, the brilliant people in the ever-changing world of Computer Science are coming up with ideas of how to deal with these serious issues every single day.
		</p>
		<p>
			To start with, the encryption methods that are currently used would take an outside observer billions upon billions of years to break. At this current time, encrypting data works with the principle of asymmetric encryption. It uses two keys, a public key and a private key. The beauty of this system is that when one key is used for encrypting, the only way to decrypt it is to use the other key of the pair. This means, that you can share the encryption key to anyone in the world and only the person with the other corresponding key can decrypt any meaningful information. One of the most famous encryption algorithms at the moment is called the SHA-256 encryption algorithm, which has a whopping 2 to the power of 256 or 115 quattuorvigintillion (thatâ€™s a 78 digit number)  possibilities. There is a fun way of visualising the computational power needed to break this cypher and it can be seen in this link here. Though the most unbelievable fact of this is that a user who has the private key can access the hidden information in the blink of an eye. This is what keeps our online bank accounts safe, our Facebook profiles confidential and your Bitcoins... Thus, no hacker would invest the time needed to steal private information from other users. At least until the infamous P = NP problem is solved.
		</p>
		<p>
			The other perhaps less interesting, but yet still integrally important part of user protection is practising common sense when accessing the Internet and using Anti-malware software. The golden rule is that: when something is too good to be true, it most probably is.

			[some other security method]
		</p>
		<p>
			Today it can be said that we have a pretty sturdy foundation regarding cybersecurity and all of its intricacies. Unfortunately, the driving force for these new security implementations, innovation, is also leading to some problems of its own. For instance, the advent of quantum computing can spell the end for the main encryption methods such as the aforementioned SHA-256, since it can do the incredible amount of checks in only a fraction of the time. Also, AI and machine learning algorithms are getting much better at guessing people's most used passwords. All of these problems are worries for the future though, so we will cross that bridge once we get there.
