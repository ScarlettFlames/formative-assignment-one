    			Our current estimates show, that the Internet is accessible to a mindboggling 4.66 billion people. That is, about 60%
    			of the entire population can go and explore this web of seemingly limitless information and possibilities.

					Even though computer power has increased by many orders of magnitude, the main principles regarding information security have remained the same.
					The fundamental tenets of information security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. According to the LBMC,
					every element of an information security program should be designed to achieve one or more of these principles.
					As such, many programmers aim to implement security measures that are both incredibly difficult to break, but intuitive to use, implement and control.

				To dive into the specific examples of modern cybersecurity, it would be useful to firstly have a look at the most common threats that we have to identify and learn to combat.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the most common forms of cybernetic threats out there are not even based in the digital world,
				but instead focuses on manipulating human beings and is often referred to as social engineering.
				Phishing attacks are a subset of social engineering strategy that imitate a trusted source and concoct a seemingly logical scenario
				for handing over login credentials or other sensitive personal data. They also can take advantage of a person's weaknesses, curiosity,
				greed or empathy. Various baiting scenarios ranging from too-good-to-be-true advertisements to having wills of royalties
				being places on ones account can be used to deceive users from all around the globe. All of this combined can lead to
				even the most tightly cyber-secured places on Earth being susceptible to outsiders with a confident and convincing voice.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most well know and most often thought of threat that people want to be protected from is hacking.
				There are two types of people that can fall into this category: white hats and black hats. The former tries to centre their work around
				helping companies find bugs and holes in their security protocols and, as a result, are not regarded as criminals,
				while the latter tries to exploit systems for financial or other gains. Talented black hats can lead to devastating consequences for even the biggest of companies.
				For instance, in May of 2014, eBay reported an attack that stole about 145 million user accounts, including names, addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords.
				The online auction giant said hackers used the credentials of three corporate employees to access its network and had complete access for 229 days—more than enough time to compromise the user database.
				And this is only one of many examples. Taking a broader view of the situation, even whole countries themselves from all around the world are currently involved in a silent global cyberwar,
				where new attacks are performed every single second. The general map of it can be seen on this website here. It is indeed a scary world, so we need to find ways to ensure as much protection of our privacy and information as we can.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we have various malicious malware which can range from adding an annoying screen-melting effect to having all of your data locked in a virtually unbreakable vault,
				only accessible after you pay ransom hundreds of dollars. Malware can come in various shapes and sizes: rapidly replicating worms,
				innocent-looking trojans, a myriad of viruses, rootkits, ransomware and many more. This software was created with the intention of
				either stealing information by infiltrating deeply into the user's operating system or to simply hinder the hardware of the victim.
				There are famous cases of malware getting into the safest computer strongholds when a naive employee decided to plug in
				an innocent-looking USB stick into one of the computers and then have the whole system become compromised because of the code stored in the flash drive.

				Overall, these threats sound worrisome and sometimes disguise themselves incredibly well, thus are difficult to avoid.
				Luckily, the brilliant people in the ever-changing world of Computer Science are coming up with ideas of how to deal with these serious issues every single day.
			</p>
			<p>
				To start with, the encryption methods that are currently being implemented would take an outside observer billions upon billions of years to break.
				At this current time, encrypting data works with the principle of asymmetric encryption. It uses two keys, which are 2 strings seemingly random data,
				a public key and a private key. The beauty of this system is that when one key is used for encrypting, and the only way to decrypt it is to use the other key of the pair.
				This entails, that you can share the encryption key to anyone in the world and only the person with the other corresponding key can decrypt any meaningful information.
				One of the most famous encryption algorithms at the moment is called the SHA-256 encryption algorithm,
				which has a whopping 2 to the power of 256 or 115 quattuorvigintillion (that’s a 78 digit number)  possibilities.
				There is a fun way of visualising the computational power needed to break this cypher and it can be seen in this link here.
				Though the most unbelievable fact of this is that a user who has the private key can access the hidden information in the blink of an eye.
				This is what keeps our online bank accounts safe, our Facebook profiles confidential and your Bitcoins... 
				hus, no hacker would invest the time needed to steal private information from other users. At least until the infamous P = NP problem is solved.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other perhaps less interesting, but yet still integrally important part of user protection is practising common sense when accessing the Internet and using Anti-malware software.
				The golden rule is that: when something is too good to be true, it most probably is. For average Interner explorers, this simple rule is enough to escape from phishing attacks and spam emails.
				Another use of logical thinking is to avoid unrecognisable dodgy-looking websites as well as clicking on links which can lead to dangerous fraud webpages.
				The latter of which from first glance would seem to be difficult to check without visiting the page, but one only needs to look in the bottom left corner of their web browser to see the link address.
				Here, try it with this link. Make sure not to click it! 
	...
			</p>
			<p>
				To combat the threats posed by social engineering, companies usually invest time and financial resources in training their workers on proper safety procedures and using two-factor authentication for everything.
				Since any system is as strong as its weakest link, this strategy is essential to preemptively prepare for any manipulative attackers.
				Finally, the problem of malware is solved by using software strictly created to detect and neutralise it before it has the time to initialise its attack,
				or otherwise called anti-malware. These programs have frequently updating databases to protect users from any zero-day attacks.
				All of these tools help discourage any cyberthieves from ever trying to steal or infiltrate other systems.

				Today we have a pretty sturdy foundation regarding cybersecurity and all of its intricacies. Unfortunately, the driving force for these new security implementations,
				innovation, is also leading to some problems of its own. For instance, the advent of quantum computing can spell the end for the main encryption methods such as the aforementioned SHA-256,
				since it can do the incredible amount of checks in only a fraction of the time. Also, AI and machine learning algorithms are getting much better at guessing most used passwords.
				All of these problems are worries for the future though, so we will cross that bridge once we get there.
